      **Contributions:**
       
       - 	Fetched and developed the train data using Here API, implemented Feature Selection using Filter method - Chi2 using Python
       -  Used correlation matrix to evaluate the correlation among variables and then used N-fold cross evaluation.
       -  Developed Predictive  models from classsification algorithms Adaboost, Bagging and gradient Descent and random Forest.
       -  Evaluated and Measured Metrics with test data in Accuracy, Precision and recall and got Accuracy of 79% in test data.

      **Contributions:**
       
       - 	Used R script to import data from telecom network, performed cleansing and preprocessing data using Power queries.
       -  Used correlation matrix to evaluate the correlation among variables and then used N-fold cross evaluation.
       -  Interpreted the Mining frequent pattern using sequential pattern discovery using equivalence classes (SPADE) using R studio. 
       -  Evaluated and Measured Metrics with test data in Accuracy, Precision and recall and got Accuracy of 79% in test data.
