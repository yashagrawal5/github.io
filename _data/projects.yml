      **Contributions:**
       
       - Designed an end-to-end sales data warehouse using Pentaho DI and performed various transformations on the data (Row Normalizer, Database Lookup, if field value is null)
       - Designed a database using Star Schema and built a multi-dimensional cube using Mondrian
       - Configured the Pentaho BI server to deploy reports by creating a database connection in Pentaho Enterprise Console for central usage.

      **Contributions:**
       
       - Applied Data processing of data and feature Engineering forgetting insights, Implemented Residual Analysis on developed models
       - Developed Linear Models on different parameters metrics AIC/BIC , Applied ANOVA on the relational Databases.
       - Trained model with methods such as Random Forest , Support Vector Machine(SVM) algorithm got accuracy of 87% on test data.
       - Performed hypothesis test on the data set, built a regression model and performed predictive analysis using R.
       - Also used predict() function to predict the variables that affected the most and RMSE (Root mean square error) to check the accuracy of the prediction.
